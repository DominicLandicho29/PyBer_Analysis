# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this Analysis was to review ridesharing data and identify specific metrics such as dates, city types, and fares. We then transformed this date into various dataframes, tables, and visualized into a multiple-line chart.
## Results

As cities became more populated (Rural>Suburban>Urban), Total Fares, Rides, and Drivers increased across the board. Averages, however, were inversed with higher average fares per rides/drivers in Rural areas. 
## Summary
-- Drivers average more per ride in these rural areas, likely due to the distance of rides. Urban areas are generally more condenesed, and rural areas more spraed out, causing rides to be shorter in Urban areas.
-- Look into marketing tactics in Urban areas, as the Total Drivers nearly double the Total Rides.
-- Consider incentives for drivers in Rural/Suburban areas. More data would be needed however, to see if riders in these areas are underserved or just in less demand.
